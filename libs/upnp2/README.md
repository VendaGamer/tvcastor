# UPnP Client for Dart

This is a fork of the original [upnp](https://pub.dev/packages/upnp). But as of February 2022, this project hasn't received any updates in over a
year. In addition, the original maintainer didn't respond to any of my contact requests.

# Setup
As it seems, if you use this on iOS devices with iOS version 16 or greater, you will need special permissions. For more info, refer to [this issue](https://github.com/Butzlabben/upnp.dart/issues/7#issuecomment-1337223688).
